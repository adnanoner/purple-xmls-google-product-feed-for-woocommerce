<p><strong>Why my feed has some errors?</strong></p>
<p>Make sure all of your titles and descriptions contain proper markup.
    Titles and descriptions can not contain just & .. needs to be fully qualified HTML ie. "&" </p>

<p><strong>How do I contact support?</strong></p>
<p>We are providing 24/7 support for our products. You can contact us through live chat and ticket https://www.shoppingcartfeed.com/</p>
<p><strong>After uploading my  product xml feeds generated by the plugin I bought to Google merchant account, most of the products where rejected in google merchants.</strong></p>
<p>Each product should have at least 2 unique identifiers 
    Unique product identifiers are product codes or other identifying values associated with an individual product:
    Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs) submitted through the ‘gtin’ attribute. GTINs include UPC, EAN (in Europe), JAN (in Japan), and ISBN;
    Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) submitted through the 'mpn' attribute; and
    The manufacturer's brand name in the 'brand' attribute.

    Apparel categories: 'brand' is required. Additionally, for the categories listed below, you must submit at least 1 out of 'gtin' or 'mpn’:
    'Apparel & Accessories > Shoes'
    'Apparel & Accessories > Clothing Accesories > Sunglasses'
    'Apparel & Accessories > Handbags, Wallets & Cases > Handbags'
    'Apparel & Accessories > Jewelry > Watches'
    Media and software categories: 'gtin' is required
    All other categories: at least 2 of the following 3 identifiers are required: ‘brand’, ‘gtin’, and ‘mpn’.
    Exception: in categories where unique product identifiers are required but no such identifier exists for an item (e.g. custom goods), submit 'identifier exists' with a value of FALSE.
    If you don't provide the required unique product identifiers, your items may be removed from Google Shopping. For all of your items, we recommend submitting all three attributes (‘brand’, ‘mpn’, and ‘gtin’) where available.</p>
<p><strong>If I have 50 categories in my shop do I need to create 50 different feeds? Or can I map categories to google categories and export as one big feed?</strong></p>
<p>If you have any number of categories no matter , you can map all categories and product to a single category by selecting "All category" Option and select Google Category as parent one that match with all your product, if you are products are entirely different or Each category contain very huge number of products, then it is better to create as different feeds. Because if you have huge number of product in system, it will take a very long time to generate a single feed with all these product, may chance break operation due maximum execution time exceeding. if you are product are entirety different in each category so separate feed will help you to map each category to most matching category in google.</p>
